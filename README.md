# Mythic Minis

This project was originally created as part of the [Tech Finishing School](https://www.technativedigital.com/tech_finishing_school/). Our goal was to think of an idea for a company and product, and then to implement [this website design](https://www.figma.com/design/e1dVmC3jY27kmNUPxSYj5G/TechNative---Challenge---Company-Website?node-id=0-1&p=f) for that company and product idea.

After the Tech Finishing School concluded, I made this fork of the project to complete the features I had not previously had enough time to implement.
